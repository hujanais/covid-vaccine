# Covid-Vaccination dashboard

https://covid-vaccine-ng.vercel.app/

The idea was sprung while talking to my parents about vaccines and my elderly parents are undecided with the vaccine when it becomes available.  During our chat, they said that they didn't know how the vaccination is going in their native country so I poked around in google and quickly found data from the fine folks at https://ourworldindata.org/.  Turns out that they have a json file that is published on their github site.  

There are some fine websites out there that already shows the data but I wanted to customize something that my parents will easily be able to just click from a link I send to them via WhatsApp.  Turns out my other family members from my birth country is also looking for such information.  

This is very basic dashboard that is just a KISS.  No fancy stuff so I challenged myself a 2-3 hour hackathon to write and deploy on Vercel.  The only issue I am stuck with is that I still have to manually update the json file daily.  Automating that will be next on my list.  Initially I thought I can just go fetch the data but turns out it didn't work because the file needs to be downloaded and not served out by GitHub. Another challenge for another day.  

Enjoy.
